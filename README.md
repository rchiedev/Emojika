# About the project
This is my first completed project and was created for me to learn game development using Godot Engine.
Things that i learned from this project are:
+ Rigid bodies and collisions
+ Game states and updates
+ Autoloads and Signals

Things that i wish to learn and improve more:
+ Scene Structure (for nodes and their children)
+ Folder and File Structure
+ Determining which node should have a script for an action (ex. i was uncertain to put random emoji script at the game node or the spawner node)
+ Github (i have absolutely 0 idea how this platform works)

# Known Issues 
Some issues i notice and (hopefully??) will fix some time in the future
+ When you have 2 of the same emoji on the floor, and you drop another (same) emoji on both of them at the same time, it will combine three of them.
+ Sometimes emoji with very very VERY slow velocity (ex. sliding on the floor) won't combine when they touch the same emoji
+ (Not important) I tried messing with the emoji's mass but it probably did nothing or i set it up too small
